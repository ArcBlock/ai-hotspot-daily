    "whatHappened": "2026 年 2 月 27 日，Trump 在 Truth Social 上宣布：「我指示美国政府所有联邦机构立即停止使用 Anthropic 的技术。」此前数月，五角大楼要求 Anthropic 允许 Claude 用于「所有合法用途」，但 Anthropic 拒绝移除两项安全限制：禁止大规模国内监控、禁止完全自主武器。国防部长 Hegseth 随即将 Anthropic 列为「供应链风险」，这一标签此前仅用于外国敌对势力关联企业，从未公开用于美国公司。价值约 2 亿美元的国防部合同被取消，所有军方承包商须在 6 个月内完成替代迁移。同日晚间，OpenAI CEO Sam Altman 宣布已与五角大楼达成部署协议，声称保留了与 Anthropic 相同的「红线」。",
    "whyItMatters": "这是 AI 行业与美国政府关系的分水岭事件。对于使用 Claude API 的企业和开发者而言，虽然商业服务不受直接影响，但信号意义重大：Anthropic 的政府业务线被切断可能影响其长期营收和竞争力。更关键的是，如果你的客户是联邦机构或国防承包商，他们将被迫在 6 个月内从 Claude 迁移出去。OpenAI 趁势抢占国防市场，AI 供应商的竞争格局正在重塑。同时，超过 400 名 Google 员工和 75 名 OpenAI 员工签署了声援 Anthropic 的联名信，显示行业内部对政府强制移除 AI 安全限制存在广泛担忧。",

OpenAI struck a deal with the Pentagon hours later, claiming identical safety red lines.",
    "whatHappened": "On February 27, 2026, President Trump directed all federal agencies to \"immediately cease\" using Anthropic's technology after months of failed negotiations with the Pentagon. The core dispute: Anthropic refused to allow Claude to be used \"for all lawful purposes\" without restrictions, specifically maintaining two guardrails -- no mass domestic surveillance and no fully autonomous weapons. Defense Secretary Hegseth designated Anthropic a \"supply chain risk,\" an unprecedented action against a U.S. company, previously reserved for foreign adversaries like Huawei. The ~$200M DoD contract was terminated, and all military contractors must complete migration within 6 months. Hours later, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced a Pentagon deployment deal, stating the government agreed to let OpenAI build its own \"safety stack\" with the same red lines Anthropic fought for.",
